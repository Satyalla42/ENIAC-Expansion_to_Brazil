# ENIAC_Expansion_to_Brazil_Magist
This is a group project from the Data Science Bootcamp in WBS. 

We analyzed a relational database from a partner Magist, which is selling a variety of products in Brazil. We (ENIAC) are considering expanding to Brazil to sell our high-end tech products. 

The main points for us to analyze, where wether Brazil is the right market for our high-end techn products, how fast are deliveries and can the customer service keep up with our usual standard?
